# Investr
Investr is a web app built by developers [Arren Alexander] and [Ryan Farney]. The app pairs investors with startups looking for funding. We built a Rails API with data scraped from Angel's List and implemented Action Cable for real-time messaging.

## Features
The Investr app was built with a few key features in mind.

Investors can view start up profiles to se if they would like to match! They can also match with a startup to start a conversation.
